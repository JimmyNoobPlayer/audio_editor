INVEST reminder: all these points should be User Stories, which should be 
Independent of all other stories
Negotiable (not a contract, up for change if needed, should be in dialog with the "shareholders" and "owners")
Valuable or Vertical (able to be demonstrated to show actual results, includes everything from simple to complex to demonstrate the whole Story)
Estimable (to a good approximation)
Small (to fit in a single iteration or "sprint")
Testable (in principle, doesn't need a final test ready right now)

3c: card, conversation, confirmation: making the user story a more formally documented and realized thing. I don't believe this needs to be fully implemented with my one-person team. With two people it would be helpful, even with one it's a good idea. I don't know if I need to create physical objects, the backlog entry might be enough.

Don't start from a traditional requirements document, even when such a document is required.

level of detail can evolve as the requirements are better understood

Not equivalent to a Use Case

These backlog items are reasonable but not very precisely User Stories, good enough for now.
And of course this backlog including disorganized reminder info is very sloppy, but good enough for now.
