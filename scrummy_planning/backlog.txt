As a musician interested in finding unusual sounds that are not hampered by copyright, I want a simple editor program to create short bursts of sound, between a minute and a second, that allows me to quickly iterate on ideas and hear the final sound very quickly after designing it, (within about a minute or a few minutes).

As a programmer with knowledge of dynamic systems and how to describe them as second-order differential equations, and a knowledge of aucoustics, I want a programming framework to quickly create and modify simulated physical systems, so I can use them to produce unusual and interesting sounds.

Clean up the backlog to be in a form I wouldn't be embarrassed to show anyone. (consolidate the reminders to only the most necessary stuff)
Change these backlog items into real user stories, rewording
Add estimated time costs and priorities to these user stories.
Set up new git repository (using public email) /done 6/2/2024
upload onto GitHub
Separate pie-in-the-sky disorganized planning, formal INVEST planning, and final descriptions
clean up directory, remove "old_" files after setting up versioning control
separate all classes into separate files in the python module, including tests (pass the tests)
create and demonstrate simple-as-possible end-to-end sound generation, including Sequence. (too large...)
create usable Sequence
end-to-end demonstration of a sound creation using the editor framework.
organize the actual logic of how the editor's classes will work together, in description
change all scalar to double accuracy
